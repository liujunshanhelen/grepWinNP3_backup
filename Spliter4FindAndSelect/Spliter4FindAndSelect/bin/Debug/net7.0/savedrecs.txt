TI A Comparative Review of the Design Guidelines for Dementia-Friendly Care
  Environments in Terms of ‘Person-Centered Care’ Approach
Z1 ‘인간중심 돌봄’적인 측면에서의 치매친화환경지침 비교검토
AB Purpose: This study aims to examine how Person-Centered Care approach
  has affected the long-term elderly care facility design guidelines
  related to the dementia friendly environment, by examining the
  literature on 'Person-Centered Care' highlighted in research; to address
  the policy implications for dementia-friendly environment on basis of
  Person-centered approach. Method: The concept of Person-centered Care
  was defined, and the principles and the design features of
  Person-centered care were derived from literature review focused on
  person-centered Care and the design of environments for people with
  dementia highlighted in research. Based on the facts, this study
  examines how much Person-Centered Care approach affects the design
  guidelines for dementia-friendly environments by comparative review.
  Result: The result shows that the principles and design features of
  Person-centered Care influence on that of the selected design guidelines
  for dementia-friendly elderly care environments directly through
  comparative review. The viewpoint to dementia care environments has
  changed from person-centered care approach for dementia patients based
  on homelike environment to that expanded dementia patients' families and
  staffs who take care of them, based on community. In Korea, the
  direction of dementia care policy is in the process of gradually
  changing from a medical approach to an expanded social and
  person-centered care approach. There is a strong need to establish the
  design guideline for dementia-friendly environments to apply the
  efficient change.

TI Mary's Little Worlds: Changing Person-Space Relationships When Living
  With Dementia
AB With the case study presented in this article we explore how people with
  dementia experience and use their environment to expand our
  understanding of how architectural environments can improve their
  well-being. We focus on how relationships between people and spaces
  change for people with dementia. Using a qualitative analysis of three
  in-depth interviews with a woman living with dementia, we obtained an
  insider's perspective and a rich account of the changes in her life,
  including her lived experiences and interventions in her home
  environment. We contend that looking at people with dementia in relation
  to and interaction with their environment, combined with an explorative
  research approach, might reveal multiple and innovative possibilities in
  designing for people with dementia. To that end, and to build on
  existing architectural expertise, we suggest focusing on architectural
  ordering principles across different cases.

  focus groups to understand the impact of dementia friendly ward
  environments on nurses experiences of caring for acutely unwell patients
  with dementia. Qualified nurses and health care assistants working in an
  acute NHS Trust in England discussed their perceptions and experiences
  of working in a dementia-friendly ward environment. Four themes
  developed from the thematic analysis: (1) 'It doesn't look like a
  hospital': A changed environment, (2) 'More options to provide
  person-centred care': No one size fits all, (3) 'Before you could not
  see the patients': A constant nurse presence and (4) 'The ward remains
  the same': Resistance to change. Recommendations and implementations for

TI A Study on Therapeutic landscape environment for the elderly with
  dementia based on multisensory stimulation
AB (Background and Purpose)The acceleration of aging has resulted in many
  social problems, one of which is the imbalance between the increase in
  the population with dementia and the available social forces that help
  them live. One of the important factors causing this imbalance is how
  living spaces for elderly individuals with dementia are designed. The
  living environment of the elderly with dementia, which in most cases is
  the sanatorium, is designed without understanding the neural structure
  of the disease. In particular, we do not understand the neural activity
  relationship between the outdoor environment and the stimulus and
  response in dementia, and only focus on creating a pure indoor visual
  stimulation environment. Although the individual sensory systems of the
  elderly with dementia deteriorate, multisensory integration processing
  increases. Thus, this research proposes establishing a multisensory
  stimulation therapeutic landscape environment for the elderly with
  dementia to alleviate the mental and behavioral symptoms and delay the
  development of the disease course. (Method) This study enrolled elderly
  individuals with dementia as limited research subjects. First,
  neurological research on dementia was conducted to define the
  significance of the multisensory stimulation environment, neural
  activity of the elderly with dementia, and therapeutic landscape
  environment. Second, the relationship between the neural activity of
  elderly individuals with dementia who responded to multisensory stimuli
  and the therapeutic landscape environment was organized. Third, six
  design methods and relative design suggestions were proposed for
  creating the multisensory therapeutic landscape environment for elderly
  individuals with dementia. (Results) This study examined the
  relationship between multisensory stimulation and the therapeutic
  landscape environment of elderly individuals with dementia, to propose
  six design methods that enrich the plant species and forms of
  multisensory stimulation, strengthen tactile-centered multisensory
  stimulation, enhance the connection between sensory stimuli, symbolize
  past experience and memory, construct deductive space, and design
  time-effective activities and games. (Conclusions) It is important to
  emphasize the necessity of multisensory stimulation in the design of
  therapeutic landscape environments. Further research should be
  undertaken to chalk out the design of multisensory stimulation to
  improve the quality of life of elderly individuals with dementia. This
  study proposes a new way of constructing an outdoor therapeutic
  landscape for elderly individuals with dementia and will provide basic
  data to create an environment for improving their quality of life.

TI Environment as non pharmacological intervention in the care of

AB The physical environment can reduce dysfunctional symptoms and
  behaviours, if the information needed to understand the environment is
  embedded in the environment itself. Moreover, the environment is
  regarded as a therapeutic aid, able to enhance well-being among people
  with dementia. The actual medical model of dementia care is focused on
  impairments and lost capabilities; considering these features as the
  focus of care makes hard to aim at enhancing people's with dementia
  well-being. Hence, focusing on the experience of living with dementia,
  enables designers to create care environments that accomplish dementia

TI The Policy implications on dementia care village as dementia-friendly
  environment
Z1 치매 친화적 환경으로서 ‘치매안심마을’에 대한 정책적 고찰
AB The purpose of this study is to discuss policy implications for the
  development of dementia management policy focused on dementia care
  village. In doing so, we formed elements of dementia management based on
  person-centered care and analyzed the Hogeweyk dementia village case in
  Netherlands by using the elements. Specifically, we made five
  person-centered care components such as routineness, sociality,
  autonomy, individuality, and staff expertise. We conducted content
  analysis using 12 overseas data on Hogeweyk to find out how those
  abstract evaluation criteria were executed in practice. The principles
  of Hogeweyk can be described as making a space, where patients still can
  enjoy their lives, rather than simply having prolonged lives, and
  creating an environment focusing on what patients still can do to
  improve their quality of life. Considering person-centered care elements
  and Hogeweyk case analysis comprehensively, we suggested implications
  for dementia management policy as follows: 1) developing an activity
  model based on one’s daily routine; 2) changing perspectives on space
  for dementia care center as a daily living environment; 3) constructing
  safe environment for autonomous behavior and offering selective care
  program; 4) supporting establishment of localized dementia care village,
  considering differences in individual characteristics and living
  environment; 5) expanding the concept of dementia care partners; and 6)
  establishing village-based nursing homes for severe dementia patients
  and a test operation of the facility.

TI Person-Environment Exchange Processes in Transition into Dementia: A
  Scoping Review.
AB BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The important role that the environment plays
  in the lives of older people is widely acknowledged. To date little is
  known about person-environment processes during early stages of
  dementia. This scoping review aims to provide an overview of the
  processes involved during early dementia and the relationship to
  different dimensions of their life space.
  RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A scoping review was conducted according to
  the Johanna Briggs Institute Manual, which involved searching for
  research on early dementia and the environment across three databases.
  RESULTS: 1358 records were screened, of which 284 sources were included
  in a first categorization of the diverse relationships that exist
  between the environment and the person living with early dementia.
  Finally, 102 sources were selected that describe person-environment
  exchange processes of agency, belonging, or stress. People living with
  dementia actively shape, use, seek out, and avoid their environment as a
  reaction to both declining abilities and environmental barriers.
  Specifically, feelings of connectedness and familiarity are important.
  DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Taking both an environmental gerontology
  perspective and a processual, i.e., transition perspective broadens the
  understanding of the experience and behavior of people living with early
  dementia. They constantly interact with and shape their environment and
  desire a sense of belonging. This sense of belonging might be threatened
  by dementia but can be actively reinforced by people living with
  dementia. These person-environment processes and their dynamics over
  time should be further investigated. Especially, quantitative data and
  data on the socioeconomic environments are lacking.

TI Designing dementia-friendly hospital environments.
AB The proportion of people with dementia in general hospitals continues to
  increase. Little attention has been paid to the impact of the physical
  environment of the hospital on their care. The King's Fund's Enhancing
  the Healing Environment programme worked with 26 NHS trusts in England
  to develop more supportive design for people with dementia. Projects
  ranged from improvements to ward environments and social spaces to the
  development of gardens. The evaluation found that relatively simple,
  cost-effective changes to the physical environment of care have positive
  effects on people with dementia and those using and working in the
  services. These include reducing agitation and distress and raising
  staff morale. From this work a set of design principles for dementia
  friendly design has been developed together with evidence based
  environmental assessment tools for hospital and ward environments. The
  toolsare free to download and are being used extensively nationally and

TI The Effects of Virtual Reality-Based Education on Empathy and
  Understanding of the Physical Environment for Dementia Care Workers in
  Australia: A Controlled Study
AB Background: There is support for the effectiveness of virtual reality
  (VR) technology in dementia education. However, it is not yet known if
  VR is a useful tool for improving empathy and understanding of dementia
  care environments among dementia care workers.
  Objective: This study compared learning outcomes of VR versus non-VR
  (control) workshops for dementia care workers of different ages and
  English-speaking backgrounds.
  Methods: Dementia care workers enrolled in workshops on dementia care
  principles. Once participants were enrolled, workshops were assigned at
  random to deliver non-VR or VR-based education. Participants (N= 114,
  91.8% female, mean age = 46.4; SD = 13.2; n= 60VR condition, 54control
  condition) completed self-report measures of empathy towards people
  living with dementia, understanding of dementia care environments,
  dementia knowledge, and attitudes towards dementia at pre- and
  post-workshop.
  Results: Significant pre-post main effects were observed for empathy,
  understanding of dementia care environments, and attitudes. Interaction
  effects were not found; improvements in outcomes were similar between
  conditions. However, interaction effects were observed for subgroups.
  Empathy improved significantly more in the VR condition for older
  participants. Understanding of dementia care environments improved more
  in the VR condition for younger and non-English-speaking background
  participants.
  Conclusion: Using VR may not augment teaching outcomes for all learners.

TI The Role of the Home Environment in Dementia Care and Support:
  Systematic review of Qualitative Research
AB Background The domestic home is the preferred site for care provision
  for people with dementia and their families, therefore creating a
  dementia and caring friendly home environment is crucial. This
  systematic review synthesised qualitative studies to explore the role of
  the home environment and identify potential barriers and facilitators in
  home dementia care and support to inform future practice and research.
  Methods A systematic search in 12 databases identified international
  qualitative literature on perceptions and experiences of
  community-dwelling people with dementia, family and formal carers
  regarding the role of the home environment and ways to tackle daily
  challenges. Results Forty qualitative studies were included and analysed
  using thematic synthesis. The main three themes were: 'home as a
  paradox', 'there is no magic formula' and 'adapting the physical space,
  objects and behaviour'. Findings indicate that home is an important
  setting and is likely to change significantly responding to the changing
  nature of dementia. Themes were later validated by family carers of
  people with dementia. Conclusions The home environment is an important
  setting for care and needs to remain flexible to accommodate changes and
  challenges. Family carers and people with dementia implement and often
  improvise, various environmental strategies. Continuous and tailor-made
  support at home is required.

TI The physical and social environments of small rural nursing homes:
  Assessing supportiveness for residents with dementia
AB The physical and social environments are recognized as important
  therapeutic tools in the care of nursing home residents with dementia,
  yet little is known about the environments of rural nursing homes. This
  study was conducted in one rural health authority (16,000 km(2)) in the
  province of Saskatchewan. Long-term institutional care was provided in
  seven small (15 to 35 beds), publicly funded nursing homes, none of
  which had separate dementia special care units (SCUs). The Physical
  Environmental Assessment Protocol (PEAP) was used to evaluate the
  facilities on nine key dimensions of dementia care environments.
  Facilities were most supportive in provision of privacy and least
  supportive on maximizing awareness and orientation. Focus groups were
  conducted with registered nurses, nursing aides, and activity workers.
  Staff caregivers identified six special needs of residents with dementia
  that were difficult to meet in the nursing homes, two of which were
  related to the physical environment (safety and a calm, quiet
  environment) and four of which were related to the social environment
  (meaningful activity and one-to-one contact, opportunity to use
  remaining abilities, flexible policy, and knowledgeable caregivers who
  enjoy working with persons with dementia). Staff suggested separate
  dementia SCUs as one approach to managing dementia care but also
  identified challenges in creating dementia units in small rural
  facilities. Results provide support for conceptual models of dementia
  care settings that emphasize the interaction of organizational, social,
  and physical factors.

TI The Association between Quality Improvement Initiatives in Dementia Care
  and Supportive Psychosocial Work Environments in Nursing Homes
AB Background: Quality improvement initiatives can help nursing homes
  strengthen psychosocial work environments. The aim of the present study
  was to examine the association between supportive psychosocial work
  environment, and professional and organizational characteristics
  regarding quality improvement initiatives in dementia care. Methods: A
  paper questionnaire survey was administered to a convenience sample of
  365 professional caregivers in 12 special nursing homes in Japan.
  Psychosocial work environment was assessed using the Social Capital and
  Ethical Climate at the Workplace Scale to calculate a score of social
  capital in the workplace, ethical leadership, and exclusive workplace
  climate. Variables for quality improvement initiatives included type of
  home (unit-type or traditional), presence of additional benefit for
  dementia care, and professionalism in dementia care among caregivers
  evaluated using the Japanese version of the Sense of Competence in
  Dementia Care Staff Scale. Results: Elevated professionalism and
  unit-type home were significantly associated with high social capital,
  strong ethical leadership, and low exclusive workplace climate. The
  presence of dementia care benefit was not associated with any subscale
  of psychosocial work environment. Conclusions: Quality improvement
  initiatives to foster supportive psychosocial work environment should
  enhance professionalism in dementia care with unit-based team building
  of professional caregivers in special nursing homes.

TI Housing Choices and Care Home Design for People With Dementia
AB This article reviews the current state of housing for people with
  dementia by exploring housing choices available to this group, and
  identifying potential issues with design of care homes. Older people who
  wish to age in place are faced with the challenge of adapting their
  domestic environment to ensure independence, accessibility, and social
  connectivity. This is even more challenging for people with dementia who
  continue to live at home, given the risks of self-harm and getting lost.
  More imaginative and inclusive forms of collective housing are needed.
  For people with dementia, a move to a new environment is often a
  stressful experience that causes shock, withdrawal, and anger. Hence,
  more research is needed to develop more fitting long-term housing
  options for people with dementia. This article presents a brief review
  on housing choices and housing design for people with dementia.
  Interviews with managers of 22 care homes were conducted to explore
  housing choices and design issues. Results show that the main housing
  choices available to people with dementia offer different levels of
  care. The choice of care homes relates to the atmosphere of a home as
  some occupants favor a homely or relaxing environment and others prefer
  dynamic settings. A combination of appropriate level of care, a good
  atmosphere, and design quality within the care home are elements that
  lead to a more enabling environment. Design of a successful caring
  environment also requires appropriate care and a positive therapeutic
  and domestic-looking environment.

  ways in which the built environment invites its users (professionals,
  but also people with dementia themselves) to act in specific ways, as
  well as to possibilities to adjust (elements of) the building. I argue
  that along with different enactments of dementia, different positions
  become available for residents when the built environment is

  multilingualism. However, language deterioration in dementia was found
  to be related to its frequency of use and the environment, and both
  language, and deterioration were asymmetric. Although the cognitive
  reserve and protective effect of multilingualism on dementia were shown,
  the decline in language function was found to be related to psychiatric
  symptoms of dementia, delusions, and depression which were relieved by
  providing a reliable language environment. It was suggested that
  language function evaluation should be considered for dementia care.

TI "Little things matter!" Exploring the perspectives of patients with
  dementia about the hospital environment
AB BackgroundRecognising demographic changes and importance of the
  environment in influencing the care experience of patients with
  dementia, there is a need for developing the knowledge base to improve
  hospital environments. Involving patients in the development of the
  hospital environment can be a way to create more responsive services. To
  date, few studies have involved the direct voice of patients with
  dementia about their experiences of the hospital environment.
  Design and methodUsing an action research approach, we worked with
  patients with dementia and a team of interdisciplinary staff on a
  medical unit to improve dementia care. The insights provided by patients
  with dementia in the early phase shaped actions undertaken at the later
  stage to develop person-centred care within a medical ward. We used
  methods including go-along interviews, video recording and participant
  observation to enable rich data generation.
  AimThis study explores the perspectives of patients with dementia about
  the hospital environment.
  ResultsThe participants indicated that a supportive hospital environment
  would need to be a place of enabling independence, a place of safety, a
  place of supporting social interactions and a place of respect.
  ConclusionsPatient participants persuasively articulated the supportive
  and unsupportive elements in the environment that affected their
  well-being and care experiences. They provided useful insights and
  pointed out practical solutions for improvement. Action research offers
  patients not only opportunities to voice their opinion, but also
  possibilities to contribute to hospital service development.
  Implications for practiceThis is the first study that demonstrates the
  possibility of using go-along interviews and videoing with patients with
  dementia staying in a hospital for environmental redesign. Researchers,
  hospital leaders and designers should further explore strategies to best
  support the involvement of patients with dementia in design and redesign
  of hospital environments.

TI Nested social groups within the social environment of a dementia care
  assisted living setting
AB The social environments of people with dementia are complex and still
  not fully understood. Investigating how residents in a dementia care
  setting navigate and participate within social groups is critical as the
  therapeutic benefits of social engagement are unequivocal. An
  ethnographic study of social environments within a dementia care
  residence revealed that there is active socialization and even strong
  and lasting friendships formed between people with dementia. Many of
  these relationships were observed to be a part of groups, 'nested'
  within the larger social environment. These 'nested social groups' had
  unique dynamics and their structuring was often influenced by outside
  factors (e.g. physical environment and staff preferences). The existence
  of these groups has implications for the experiences and quality of life
  of the residents in long-term care. Nested social groups will be defined
  and their function within the social environment will be discussed.

TI Ageing in place and technologies of place: the lived experience of
  people with dementia in changing social, physical and technological
  environments
AB This paper explores the varied meanings and lived experiences of older
  people with dementia, in relation to everyday technologies in public
  spaces outside the home, through re-analysis of qualitative data
  generated from research that focused on the use of technology in
  supporting people with dementia to carry on with their everyday outside
  activities. The data have been re-analysed to critically examine how
  people with memory loss manage being outside in both familiar and
  unfamiliar public environments. In doing so the authors explore how
  technologies mediate between the physical and social environment in
  which people with dementia live. This paper highlights the importance of
  a neglected space within dementia research, namely the outside public
  environment. Although the outside environment and activities that take
  place in that space, for some, are curtailed, for others the physical
  and social security of familiar environments enables them to carry on
  with everyday activities in this public realm. Outside space can be both
  therapeutic and frightening and this paper demonstrates that people with
  dementia can sometimes feel out of place in public space. It however
  also shows the variety of ways people with dementia use everyday
  technologies to manage 'feeling out of place'.

TI Improving the hospital environment for people with dementia.
AB This article is the third in a series presenting examples of the
  positive work achieved by trusts who participated in the Royal College
  of Nursing's development programme to improve dementia care in acute
  hospitals. The hospital environment is often disorientating for people
  with dementia and can be particularly distressing when a patient is
  admitted in an emergency. Subsequent ward moves can also be disruptive
  and confusing, especially if they take place out of hours. Two NHS
  trusts aimed to improve the experience for patients with dementia by
  addressing the physical environment along with practical aspects of care
  provision at different stages in the hospital journey. The Queen
  Elizabeth Hospital King's Lynn NHS Foundation Trust in Norfolk enhanced
  its emergency department environment by redesigning four bays and an
  observation area to be dementia-friendly. The hospital has supported
  these changes by providing dementia awareness training for all staff in
  these areas. Walsall Healthcare NHS Trust focused on minimising ward
  moves by implementing procedures to identify patients who should not be
  moved. Since introducing the new process, adherence has been good and
  there have been fewer ward moves.

  NOVELTY - A system for preventing/remedying a dementia        
  based on a virtual reality using the Internet is        provided
  to enable a dementia patient to receive a        medical
  treatment by making the dementia patient        receive a
  medical examination in a remote place and        perform a
  dementia treating scenario on a virtual        reality on the
  Internet.
  DETAILED DESCRIPTION - If a patient connects to a web server, a     
  dementia web page is supplied on a web browser of        the
  patient(S211). Personal information of the        patient
  written in a member joining process(S213),        a patient
  detailed questions table, and a reserved        time for a
  medical examination are stored in a        member information
  DB(S214). Thus, an environment        for a remote medical
  examination between a doctor        and the patient and a
  prescription is        supplied(S215). An environment capable of
  treating        the patient is supplied in accordance with a  
  scenario in a virtual reality prescribed by the        
  doctor(S216). The result is stored in the member        
  information DB, and the result is supplied to the        
  doctor(S217). If a medical examination is received        from
  the doctor again(S218), the above stages are        repeated.

TI Requirement Elicitation and Prototype Development of an Intelligent
  Environment to Support People With Early Dementia
AB In an aging population, the prevalence of people with dementia is
  increasing. Intelligent environments can offer a solution to support
  people in the early stages of dementia, who often experience problems
  with maintaining their day-night rhythm. The focus of this work is
  developing an Intelligent Environment for assisting these people with
  their daily structure while living independently at home. Three
  co-creation methods with several stakeholder groups were used to elicit
  requirements and develop a prototype of an Intelligent Environment.
  Participants were involved in sessions using Mind Maps (N=55), Idea
  Generation Cards (N=35), and in a multidisciplinary design team with
  representatives of eight organizations. The result of these sessions was
  a set of 10 requirements for the Intelligent Environment on the
  following topics: context-awareness, pattern recognition, adaptation,
  support, personalization, autonomy, modularity, dementia proof
  interaction, costs, data and privacy. Based on these requirements,
  several scenarios were developed to explicate such an environment for
  supporting people with early dementia. The design team translated the
  requirements to a real-life prototype of an Intelligent Environment
  integrated into a demonstration home. The prototype serves as a basis
  for further development of Intelligent Environments to enable people
  with dementia to live longer independently at home.

TI Senses make sense: An individualized multisensory stimulation for
  dementia
AB Nonpharmacologic interventions have been recommended as first-line
  treatments for dementia, and multisensory stimulation environment has
  been used as a non-pharmacological treatment to dementia patients in the
  last decade. However, the clinical effect of multisensory stimulation
  environment remains temporary and uncertain. Individualized medicine has
  been suggested to hold great promise in medicine, and it should be
  equally important for dementia. Reminiscence integrating individual
  experiences into therapeutic schemes has shown potential in the field of
  improving cognitive functions and depressive symptoms for dementia
  patients, and interactive music also demonstrated a positive outcome by
  using individualized music for the hearing aspect. We therefore
  hypothesize that an individualized multisensory stimulation in a natural
  and realistic environment integrating personal experience may be an
  effective intervention for patients suffering from dementia. (C) 2016

TI 'We have different routes for different reasons': Exploring the purpose

AB This paper explores the purpose of walks for co-residing carers of
  people with dementia, using a social citizenship lens. The findings are
  based on the first phase of a study examining the everyday experiences
  of place, space, and neighbourhood of dementia carers. Using three forms
  of data collection - social network mapping, walking interviews, and
  participant-driven photography - the study brings forth information
  about why carers go on walks either alone or with the person with
  dementia. Carers explained that walks facilitate their connections with
  themselves, the person with dementia, their social environment, and
  their natural and built environment. In sum, walks provide a way of
  practicing and sustaining social citizenship. Carers' discourse about
  walks highlights their personal, everyday practices and strategies, as
  well as the larger tensions and contradictions of dementia care. The
  findings reinforce the need to bring into dialogue, from a carer
  perspective, a social citizenship model of dementia with the growing
  interest in dementia-friendly communities.

TI Oral environment and cerebral blood flow in patients with
  neurodegenerative dementia: comparison of Alzheimer type dementia and
  dementia with Lewy bodies
EA OCT 2022
AB Background The number of patients with dementia is increasing worldwide.
  Modifying risk factors may significantly reduce the prevalence and cost
  of dementia. The number of remaining teeth, occlusal force, denture use,
  and periodontal disease status are associated with the risk of
  developing dementia. The oral environment may be a risk factor for
  dementia. This study aimed to investigate the association between the
  oral environment and cerebral blood flow in patients with mild cognitive
  impairment and dementia (either Alzheimer type dementia (ATD) or
  dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB)). We aimed to identify differences in
  the oral environment according to the underlying neurodegenerative
  disease. Methods The participants were 25 patients with ATD and 25
  patients with DLB who visited the Department of Dementia and Geriatric
  Medicine, Kanagawa Dental University Hospital. Patients were diagnosed
  with ATD and DLB by well-trained specialists certified by the Japanese
  Dementia Society and categorised as Level 3 or 4 by the Functional
  Assessment Staging of Alzheimer Disease scale. The correlation between
  oral environment (number of teeth, periodontal tissue, and oral
  function) and cerebral blood flow in each brain area calculated by
  single photon emission computed tomography was examined. Results The DLB
  group showed a significant correlation between masticatory performance
  and cerebral blood flow in some areas, while no such correlation was
  observed in the ATD group. Significant correlations were found between
  periodontal pocket depth and bleeding on probing and cerebral blood flow

TI People with dementia and the hospital environment: the view of patients
  and family carers.
AB BACKGROUND: A metropolitan geriatric evaluation and management (GEM)
  facility in Australia was undergoing expansion, and consideration for
  the needs of individuals with dementia and their family carers was
  identified as important in planning the new facility. Existing
  literature revealed that people in hospital value privacy, minimal
  noise, family amenities and homeliness, but these findings did not
  consider the perspectives of the person with dementia specifically.
  AIM: The aim was to elicit the perspectives of current inpatients with
  dementia, and their family carers, about the environment/design features
  that they believe are necessary for people with dementia, and their
  family carers.
  METHOD AND DESIGN: This qualitative study utilised in-depth
  semi-structured interviews to obtain information from current inpatients
  with dementia and their family carers.
  RESULTS: Participants described how the care received was more important
  than the physical environment; however, participants also valued
  homeliness, privacy for the patient and for conversations, a shared
  space without a television and a connection to the outside. Participants
  described how accommodating carers, providing quiet spaces and
  appropriate amenities were also important.
  CONCLUSIONS: While participants valued care over the physical
  surroundings, they also offered valuable information about their
  experience in the ward environment. Despite cognitive difficulties,
  people with dementia were able to provide useful information about the
  environment within which they were being cared.
  IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Consumer opinions about hospital
  design/environment should be considered as an important source of data.
  Privacy and personal space for people with dementia and their family
  carers, a connection with the outside environment , and the needs of
  carers and visitors are all important considerations when designing
  healthcare environments.

TI Effects of physical and social environments on the risk of dementia
  among Taiwanese older adults: a population-based case-control study
AB Background Physical and social environments may influence cognition
  health in older adults. However, evidence regarding physical and social
  environments linked to dementia is lacking, especially in Asia. This
  study aims to explore the influence of physical and social environments
  on the incidence of dementia through a population-based case-control
  design in Taiwan. Methods We identified 26,206 incident cases with
  dementia aged >= 65 years in 2010, with the same no. of controls from
  National Health Insurance claims. Environmental measures were collected
  from government statistics including three physical environments and
  three social environments. Multilevel logistic regression was used to
  estimate the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of the
  association between dementia incidence and the environmental measures at
  the township level. Results We observed a significant reduction of 12%
  in the odds ratios of dementia in areas with higher availability of
  playgrounds and sport venues (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.81-0.95), after
  controlling for individual and other environmental characteristics.
  Community center availability was also significantly associated with an
  8% decreased odds for dementia (OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.87-0.99), but the
  association was not significant after further consideration of
  individual-level characteristics. Although higher odds of dementia were
  found in areas with high median annual family income (OR 1.14, 95% CI
  1.04-1.25), such a significant relationship did not appear in the full
  model. Conclusions Our study suggests that specific physical and social
  environmental features have different influences on the risk of
  dementia. Public health interventions may consider these environmental
  aspects for preventing dementia incidence.

  strategies is limited by rudimentary and often-conflicting theories.
  Using a theory-synthesis approach conducted within the perspective of
  the need-driven dementia-compromised behavior model, this article
  presents the locomoting responses to environment in elders with dementia
  (LRE-EWD) model. This new model, based on empirical and theoretical
  evidence, integrates the role of emotion with that of cognition in
  explicating a person-environment dynamic supporting wandering and other
  dementia-related disturbances. Included is evidence of the theory's
  testability and elaboration of its implications. The LRE-EWD model
  resolves conflicting views and evidence from current research on

TI Informal social interaction among residents with dementia in special
  care units: Exploring the role of the physical and social environments
AB Despite a continued recognition of the importance of relational aspects
  of quality of life for people with dementia, little research has
  examined environmental influences on informal social interaction in
  dementia care settings. The purpose of this ethnographic study was to
  identify and explore key elements of the physical and social
  environments that act as facilitators or barriers for social interaction
  among people with dementia living in special care units. We conducted
  in-depth interviews with staff members and completed a series of
  resident observations. Findings suggest that social factors such as
  staff work roles and resident group size, and physical factors such as a
  non-institutional character, the nursing station location, and adequate
  seating and sightlines are influential for prompting or supporting
  informal social interactions. Design recommendations are provided with

TI Hospitality in dementia-friendly environments is significant to
  caregivers during hospitalisation of their loved ones. A qualitative
  study
EA JUN 2022
AB Aim and objectives To explore what is meaningful to caregivers in
  relation to a dementia-friendly environment during hospitalisation of
  their loved ones with dementia or cognitive impairment. Background
  Implementation of dementia-friendly initiatives and person-centred care
  approach have shaped the political agenda within Danish society.
  Patients with dementia or cognitive impairment and their accompanying
  caregivers are challenged when admitted to hospital. During
  hospitalisation, caregivers find themselves in a vulnerable state of
  mind. Thus, the implementation of a dementia-friendly environment and
  adherence to person-centred care in hospital settings leaves room for
  improvement. Methods This study was guided by a qualitative and
  explorative approach. Data were collected through 17 semi-structured
  interviews with caregivers at a subacute neurological ward. Thematic
  analysis was employed to interpret data. The study reports according to
  the COREQ checklist. Results The following three themes were identified:
  1) Being a watchful bystander. 2) Visiting an undefined and foreign
  environment. 3) Longing for kindness. Conclusion Hospitality expressed
  by staff towards caregivers is significant in allowing caregivers to
  experience hospital environments as "friendly." Dementia-friendly
  environments embrace existential aspects that go far beyond physical
  spaces; hence, experiences of kind acts shape caregivers' sense of
  safety and comfort during hospitalisation. Hospitality is an essential
  part of nursing in dementia care because caregivers are contextually
  vulnerable. Our study sheds new light on the provision of person-centred
  care to people with dementia and their families in healthcare. Relevance
  to clinical practice Nurses need to be aware that caregivers experience
  vulnerability and to involve caregivers in the care provided for
  patients with dementia. We recommend that a permanent contact person be
  appointed to follow patients throughout their admission period.
  Furthermore, systematic interventions focusing on phenomena such as
  hospitality and kindness may serve to form a person-centred clinical
  culture; an issue that warrants further investigation.

TI Supporting dementia patients in hospital environments: health-related
  risks, needs and dedicated structures for patient care
AB The diagnostics and treatment of dementia are progressively gaining
  importance for European neurologists. Our hospital structures are poorly
  prepared for patients suffering from dementia. As a consequence of
  cognitive and physical deficits, dementia patients have an increased
  risk for serious complications and poor outcomes in hospital
  environments. In this review, the specific needs of dementia patients
  are outlined, describing how geriatricians, neurologists and
  psychiatrists may contribute to better patient care, e.g. with
  consultation or liaison services, geriatric wards, dedicated dementia
  wards or memory clinics in interaction with nurses, occupational
  therapists, physiotherapists, speech therapists, psychologists and
  social workers. Due to their multifaceted needs, dementia patients can
  most successfully be supported in clinical environments that closely
  integrate specialized inpatient, outpatient and primary care offers.

TI Increasing understanding of environmental modifications using the
  Virtual Dementia Experience for professional carers of people living
  with dementia
EA AUG 2021
AB Modifications to the environment can have a positive impact on the
  person living with dementia. The purpose of this study was to examine
  the effects of a virtual reality (VR) educational workshop on improving
  understanding of the impact of environments for people living with
  dementia for carers in residential aged care facilities in Australia.
  Participants were nonrandomly allocated to one of two conditions: a VR
  condition which enabled them to take the perspective of a person living
  with dementia as they navigate a home environment (n = 40), or to a
  non-VR condition, in which participants received equivalent information
  in a classroom without the use of VR (n = 56). Participants completed a
  purpose-built pictorial measure of their understanding of environmental
  factors that could impact on people with dementia before and after the
  workshop. Following education, an analysis of covariance revealed that
  compared to non-VR education, those who received VR education identified
  a significantly greater number of appropriate environmental
  modifications, after adjusting for practice test scores. The results
  from this study demonstrate the utility of VR as a promising tool to
  improve carers' understanding of the ways in which the environment can
  be modified to assist people living with dementia.

TI Use of the physical environment to support everyday activities for
  people with dementia: A systematic review
AB Difficulty with everyday activities is a key symptom and defining
  feature of dementia, relating to subjective reports of well-being and
  overall quality of life. One way to support individuals in their daily
  activities is by modifying the physical environment to make it easier to
  interact with during activity performance. This systematic review
  explores the range of studies available using physical environmental
  strategies to support performance in everyday activities for people with
  dementia. Seventy-two relevant studies were identified by the search.
  Physical environmental strategies included changes to the global
  environment and to architectural features, use of moveable environmental
  aids and tailored individual approaches. Strategies supported general
  everyday activity functioning (N=19), as well as specific activities,
  particularly mealtimes (N=15) and orientation in space (N=16); however,
  few studies were found that focused on aspects of personal care such as
  dressing (N=1) and showering or the preferred hobbies of individuals
  (N=0). Overall, there appeared to be a lack of research within private
  home environments, and of studies which specify the dementia syndrome or
  the whole neuropsychological profile of people with dementia. More work
  is needed to extend theoretical understandings of how people with
  dementia interact with their environments so that these spaces can be
  designed to further support activities of daily living performance.
  Future work in this field could also incorporate the perspectives and
  preferences of those living with dementia.

TI Decreasing spatial disorientation in care-home settings: How psychology
  can guide the development of dementia friendly design guidelines
AB Alzheimer's disease results in marked declines in navigation skills that
  are particularly pronounced in unfamiliar environments. However, many
  people with Alzheimer's disease eventually face the challenge of having
  to learn their way around unfamiliar environments when moving into
  assisted living or care-homes. People with Alzheimer's disease would
  have an easier transition moving to new residences if these larger, and
  often more institutional, environments were designed to compensate for
  decreasing orientation skills. However, few existing dementia friendly
  design guidelines specifically address orientation and wayfinding. Those
  that do are often based on custom, practice or intuition and not well
  integrated with psychological and neuroscientific knowledge or
  navigation research, therefore often remaining unspecific. This paper
  discusses current dementia friendly design guidelines, reports findings
  from psychological and neuropsychological experiments on navigation and
  evaluates their potential for informing design guidelines that decrease
  spatial disorientation for people with dementia.

AB While there is considerable evidence on the impact of specific design
  features on problems associated with dementia, the link between the
  quality of the built environment and quality of life of people with
  dementia is largely unexplored. This study explored the environmental
  and personal characteristics that are associated with quality of life in

  from 275 residents of 35 aged care homes and analysed using linear
  regression. The quality of the built environment was significantly
  associated with the quality of life of the resident measured by global
  self-report. Environmental ratings were not associated with proxy or
  detailed self-report ratings. Higher quality of life is associated with
  buildings that facilitate engagement with a variety of activities both
  inside and outside, are familiar, provide a variety of private and
  community spaces and the amenities and opportunities to take part in
  domestic activities.

TI A New and Tidier Setting How Does Environmental Clutter Affect People
  With Dementia's Ability to Perform Activities of Daily Living?
AB Background: The relationship between the physical environment and the
  person with dementia's (PwD) activities of daily living (ADLs) task
  performance is controversial. Although the general assumption is that
  this population benefits from their home environment when performing
  ADLs, very few experimental studies have been conducted to date.
  Objectives: The aim was to investigate the influence of the environment
  (home vs. Research-lab) and the role of clutter on ADL performance.
  Methods: Sixty-five PwD were evaluated with a performance-based ADL
  assessment (at home and clutter-free Research-lab). Paired t tests
  compared ADL performance and level of clutter in both environments.
  Multiple regression analysis investigated factors associated with better
  ADL performance. Results: Overall, PwD performed better at home even
  though clutter was significantly lower in the Research-lab. When
  stratified by dementia stage, PwD in the moderate stage of the disease
  performed better at home. Conclusion: Absence of clutter in the
  Research-Lab did not appear to play a beneficial role in ADLs. When
  stratified by dementia stage, only PwD in the moderate stage appeared to
  benefit from their home environment when performing ADL tasks. Future
  studies are required to elucidate the wider role of the environment in
  supporting engagement in daily activities in different dementia stages.

TI A caring and living environment that supports the spirituality of older
  people with dementia: A hermeneutic phenomenological study
EA DEC 2022
AB Introduction: Meeting spiritual needs is an important part of the
  quality of nursing for older people living with dementia. The
  spirituality-supportive caring and living environment has rarely been
  studied, even though the environment plays an important role in
  supporting the well-being of older people with dementia.Aim: To further
  understanding about the spirituality-supportive elements of a caring and
  living environment from the perspective of older people with dementia
  and their family members.Design, setting and participants: We adapted
  hermeneutic phenomenology as a philosophical background and
  methodological approach in this study. After receiving the approval of
  the researcher's University Ethics Committee, a purposive sample of ten
  older people with dementia and their nine family members, in home care
  and long-term care settings in Southern Finland were recruited for
  interviews.Methods: An interview-based study was conducted using
  photography to collect the data. The in-depth interviews were conducted
  in dyads between September 2017 and March 2020 and transcribed verbatim.
  Thematic analysis was used to interpret the data.Results: Spirituality
  was seen as a continuum within human life, manifested through the
  environment even if older people with dementia were unable to express
  themselves. The spirituality experiences of the participants within the
  caring and living environment were summarized into three themes: "Where
  do I belong?", "What remains of me in the world?" and "Where am I
  going?" The older people, their family members and other people involved
  in their care provided a caring and living environment that supported
  spirituality with opportunities to seek answers to these questions
  through to the meaning of their life.Discussion and conclusions: This
  hermeneutic phenomenological study provides a new insight into the
  environment that supports the spirituality of older people with
  dementia. The elements of caring and living environment can remind older
  people with dementia of what supports their own way of thinking about
  spirituality and brings meaning to their life. Therefore, spirituality
  is worth of considering when planning a caring and living environment
  that supports what is important to the personhood of older people with
  dementia. Tweetable abstract: Spirituality is worth of considering when
  planning a caring and living environment that supports what is important
  to the personhood of older people with dementia.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

  in home and clinic settings.
AB OBJECTIVES: Evaluating functional level of persons with diagnosed or
  suspected dementia is an important part of occupational therapy. The
  importance of the environment is often highlighted. We investigated the
  ability of clients with suspected dementia to perform instrumental
  activities of daily living (IADLs) in the clinic versus in their homes.
  METHOD: We used the Assessment of Motor and Process Skills (AMPS) to
  measure the motor and process skill ability of 19 clients with suspected
  dementia.
  RESULTS: Using two-tailed paired t-tests, we found no overall difference
  in IADL motor or process performance between the clinic and home
  setting. However, of the 19 clients, 6 had motor ability measures,
  whereas 5 had process ability measures that differed significantly
  between the two settings.
  CONCLUSION: The results suggest that if we want to know how a person
  with suspected dementia performs in IADLs in a specific environment we
  should test him or her in that environment.

AB Limited research explores the experience of individuals with dementia in
  acute care geriatric psychiatry units. This observational case study
  examines the influence of the physical environment on behavior
  (wandering, pacing, door testing, congregation and seclusions) among
  residents in a traditional geriatric psychiatry unit who were then
  relocated to a purpose-built acute care unit. Purpose-built environments
  should be well suited to the needs of residents with dementia. Observed
  trends revealed differences in spatial behaviors in the pre- and
  post-environments attributable to the physical environment.
  Person-centred modifications to the current environment including
  concerted efforts to know residents are meaningful in fostering quality
  of life. Color coded environments (rooms vs dining areas etc.) to
  improve wayfinding and opportunities to personalize rooms that address
  the 'hominess' of the setting also have potential. Future research could

TI Designing Supportive Soundscapes for Nursing Home Residents with
  Dementia
AB Sound and its resulting soundscape is a major appraisal component of the
  living environment. Where environmental sounds (e.g., outdoor traffic
  sounds) are often perceived as negative, a soundscape (e.g., containing
  natural sounds) can also have a positive effect on health and
  well-being. This supportive effect of a soundscape is getting increasing
  attention for use in practice. This paper addresses the design of a
  supportive sonic environment for persons with dementia in nursing homes.
  Starting from a review of key mechanisms related to sonic perception,
  cognitive deficits and related behavior, a framework is derived for the
  composition of a sonic environment for persons with dementia. The
  proposed framework is centered around using acoustic stimuli for
  influencing mood, stimulating the feeling of safety and triggering a
  response in a person. These stimuli are intended to be deployed as added
  sounds in a nursing home to improve the well-being and behavior of the
  residents.

TI Built Environment Design Interventions at the Exits of Secured Dementia
  Care Units: A Review of the Empirical Literature
EA OCT 2022
AB Purpose: To review evidence around design interventions that influence
  exiting attempts in dementia care units, informing architectural and
  clinical practice. Background: Built environment design is recognized as
  important in the care and management of responsive behaviors for those
  living with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias in secured dementia
  care units (e.g., exiting attempts, agitation). The repetitious behavior
  of "walking with purpose" (previously termed wandering) in those with
  dementia has influenced safety-related architectural design components
  of dementia care units that decrease exiting attempts. Empirical
  literature addressing design interventions to prevent exiting for those
  with dementia is lacking and outdated. Methods: We sought to describe
  known design techniques through a topical analysis of experimental
  studies. A thorough search for empirical studies that assessed interior
  design interventions at exit doors within dementia care units was
  undertaken. The review included an extensive search for existing
  literature and a screening of each study identified for its relevance,
  quality, and applicability. Results: The experimental studies included
  in the review collectively assessed five interior design interventions
  at egress doorways: implementing horizontal and vertical floor grid
  patterns, mirrors, murals, conditioning responses to color cues, and
  camouflaging door hardware or vision panels. Why empirical studies have
  not continued more recently as built environment trends have shifted
  toward promoting meaningful and purposeful movement through design are
  considered. Advances in our understanding around the pathophysiology of
  dementia which might affect future design interventions related to
  egress are also identified. Conclusion: The built environment is an
  important part of dementia care, and further prospective research is
  needed on the role of design interventions in the context of exiting
  attempts within secured units and subsequent behavior outcomes.

TI Managing a Dual Diagnosis of Cancer and Dementia in an Acute Setting:
  Considerations, Implications, and Future Recommendations
EA NOV 2021
AB Objectives: To present an overview of the issues related to the
  well-being of people affected by cancer and dementia. To highlight the
  evidence from dementia care that can help improve the care experiences
  of people with dementia and cancer. Data Sources: Electronic databases
  such as PubMed and CINAHL were used to retrieve relevant literature
  published between 2010 and 2020. Conclusion: Having a dual diagnosis of
  dementia and cancer poses several challenges across the cancer care
  pathway. Communication, treatment decision-making, environment ,and
  time-related issues were all identified. The literature suggests the
  need for evidence-based guidelines taking into consideration the person
  and the environment to support this population. Implications for Nursing
  Practice: To address these challenges and offer an optimal care
  experience for this group and their families, solutions need to focus
  both on the workforce and the environment. Offering dementia education
  for professionals working in acute cancer care, as well as adapting
  local environments that facilitate people navigate the space can be a
  starting point to offer person-centered, rights-based dementia sensitive
  care. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Care needs of people with dementia in the peri-operative environment: A
  systematic review
AB The care of people with dementia within the hospital setting is
  challenging for healthcare professionals. Hospital design and services
  are not optimized for people with dementia, owing to the lack of
  preparation of healthcare professionals and the busy environment of the
  acute hospital. The peri-operative environment may present particular
  difficulties but little is known about the experience and care of people
  with dementia in this setting. The aim of this review was to examine the
  care of surgical patients who have dementia and their family members in
  peri-operative environments and describe strategies adopted by
  healthcare professionals. A systematic search of the following databases
  was completed: BNI, CINAHL, PubMED and PsychINFO in accordance with
  PRISMA guidelines. Data were extracted and analysed within a thematic
  analysis framework as described byBraun and Clarke. Ten papers based on
  eight studies were included, five (n = 355,010 participants) containing
  quantitative data and five reporting qualitative data (n = 395
  participants). People with dementia who go undergo surgery experienced
  higher adverse post-operative outcomes such as respiratory problems or
  urinary tract infections. The key elements in surgical care for people
  with dementia included: health assessment throughout the surgical
  trajectory (pre-, intra- and post-operative) and the resources used by
  healthcare professionals in the peri-operative care. Healthcare
  professionals reported difficulties in the completion of health
  assessments due to the cognitive status of people with dementia and a
  lack of skills in dementia management. The use of restraints was still a
  common practice and a source of conflict. Dementia-specific training and
  guidelines focused on the care of surgical patients who have dementia in
  peri-operative environments are required to improve care and
  post-operative outcomes. More research is required to develop effective
  interventions to improve care and decrease the risk of complications for
  people with dementia in the peri-operative care environment.

TI Designing Dementia Care Pathways to Transform Non Dementia-Friendly
  Hospitals: Scoping Review
AB People with dementia (PwD) occupy around 25% of the hospital beds. Once
  PwD are admitted to hospitals, their cognitive impairment is not
  considered in most of the cases. Thus, it causes an impact on the
  development of the disease becoming a stressful situation as care plans
  are not adapted to PwD. The aim of this study was to explore the
  published core elements when designing a dementia care pathway for
  hospital settings. A scoping review was conducted to provide an overview
  of the available research evidence and identify the knowledge gaps
  regarding the topic. This review highlights person-centered care,
  compassionate care and end-of-life process as some of the key elements
  that should integrate the framework when designing a dementia care
  pathway. Architectonical outdoor and indoor hospital elements have also
  been found to be considered when adapting the healthcare context to PwD.
  Findings provide information about the key points to focus on to
  successfully design dementia interventions in hospital environments
  within available resources, mostly in those contexts in which national
  dementia plans are in its infancy. Hospitals should transform their
  patients' routes and processes considering the increasing demographic
  changes of people with cognitive impairment.

TI Putting responsive behaviours in place: Examining how formal and
  informal carers understand the actions of people with dementia
AB Living alongside and working with people with dementia who yell or
  strike out can be very demanding and sometimes harmful. It is generally
  understood that such actions may be a response to the social and
  physical environment, yet very little attention has been paid to
  understanding what role the environment plays in eliciting and
  responding to these actions across different settings. Drawing on 27
  semi-structured interviews with formal and informal carers, this article
  examines how carers understand the actions of people with dementia in
  relation to their environment. We identify individual, interpersonal,
  local environmental, macro-scale and temporal dynamics that influence
  the actions of people with dementia and carers' capacities to work with
  them. Drawing on relational thinking and the concept of structural
  violence, we argue that many of the problems and solutions associated
  with aggressive actions are located outside the person with dementia in
  broader relations and systems of care. We conclude with a discussion of
  how these understandings can inform developments in the systems of home
  and community care.

TI Rationales and practices for dynamic stakeholder engagement and
  disengagement. Evidence from dementia-friendly health and social care
  environments
EA OCT 2019
AB Latest developments in stakeholder management literature focus on
  dynamic stakeholder engagement and disengagement practices, and how
  these are facilitated towards reaching systemic outcomes. However,
  limited evidence support that this network-level approach can positively
  influence project success. The paper analyses this issue by considering
  the practices (how and when), rationales (why) and outcomes (so what)
  that evolve in the dynamic management of external stakeholders in
  dementia-friendly environments. This is a crucial area to explore as the
  ageing population and rising dementia prevalence has increased the need
  to engage external stakeholders, such as people living with dementia, to
  develop dementia-friendly health and social environments. The empirical
  study of the 2013/2014 Department of Health National Dementia Capital
  Investment Programme involved a statistical and qualitative analysis of
  98 pilot projects? final lessons learnt reports. The analysis advances
  the dynamic process of timely engaging and disengaging external
  stakeholders in a context not previously explored in the literature
  related to dementia-friendly environments. Eight recurring practices and
  six rationales, the latter characterized by their temporal dimension,
  are presented in a processual model of stakeholder management.

TI Dyadic interactions and physical and social environment in dementia
  mealtime care: a systematic review of instruments
EA JUL 2021
AB Using valid instruments to measure dyadic interactions and physical and
  social environment during mealtime care of persons with dementia is
  critical to evaluate the process, fidelity, and impact of mealtime
  interventions. However, the characteristics and quality of existing
  instruments remain unexplored. This systematic review described the
  characteristics and synthesized the psychometric quality of instruments
  originally developed or later modified to measure mealtime dyadic
  interactions and physical and/or social dining environment for people
  with dementia, on the basis of published reports between January 1, 1980
  and December 31, 2020. We identified 26 instruments: 17 assessed dyadic
  interactions, one assessed physical environment, and eight assessed
  physical and social environment. All instruments were used in research
  and none in clinical practice. All instruments were observational tools
  and scored as having low psychometric quality, except for the refined
  Cue Utilization and Engagement in Dementia (CUED) mealtime video-coding
  scheme rated as having moderate quality. Reasons for low quality are the
  use of small samples compared with the number of items, limited
  psychometric testing, and inadequate estimates. All existing tools
  warrant further testing in larger diverse samples in varied settings and
  validation for use in clinical practice. The refined CUED is a potential
  tool for use and requires testing in direct on-site observations.

TI Layers of Influence: Important Contextual Factors in Directing Dementia
  Care Programs
AB Researchers have documented the powerful influence of the physical and

  studies fail to include contextual assessments when exploring outcomes.
  As part of a larger study assessing a horticultural therapy (HT)
  intervention, the authors explored the contextual and procedural factors
  that impacted results. Guided by the theory of environmental press,
  interviews were conducted with five of the study's activity facilitators
  who worked in seven dementia care programs possessing varied social and
  physical environments. Findings indicated that the theory of
  environmental press should be expanded beyond the person with dementia
  and applied to program facilitators. A hierarchical relationship became
  evident; for program participants to achieve congruence between their
  competence and their environment, the facilitator must first achieve
  such a fit. Facilitators with fewer competencies were more vulnerable to
  the shortcomings of their environments; supportive environments can
  minimize deficits in competence.

  have been operationalized in observational studies of cognitive aging
  and dementia. Methods: A systematic search in PubMed and Web of Science
  identified studies of social environment exposures and late-life
  cognition/dementia outcomes. Data were extracted on (1) study design;
  (2) population; (3) social environment(s); (4) cognitive outcome(s); (5)
  analytic approach; and (6) theorized causal pathways. Studies were
  organized using a 3-tiered social ecological model at interpersonal,
  community, or policy levels. Results: Of 7802 non-duplicated articles,
  123 studies met inclusion criteria. Eighty-four studies were
  longitudinal (range 1-28 years) and 16 examined time-varying social
  environments. When sorted into social ecological levels, 91 studies
  examined the interpersonal level; 37 examined the community/neighborhood
  level; 3 examined policy level social environments; and 7 studies
  examined more than one level. Conclusions: Most studies of social
  environments and cognitive aging and dementia examined interpersonal
  factors measured at a single point in time. Few assessed time-varying
  social environmental factors or considered multiple social ecological
  levels. Future studies can help clarify opportunities for intervention
  by delineating if, when, and how social environments shape late-life
  cognitive aging and dementia outcomes.

  important factors for patients with dementia are physical security and
  mental stability. Some studies emphasize the importance of maintaining,
  yet, intact physical abilities. In order to maintain one’s functional
  ability at its highest, emphasis in designing with consideration of the
  layout, location and pattern is crucial. Redesigning facilities and
  caring environment with patients’ own furniture and art can reduce
  stress. Prolongation of one’s life rather than severance can maintain
  healthy environment. Simplification of the environment with maximum use

  design innovation for caring facilities and innovation and sustainable
  healthy physical activity to improve the lives of dementia patients.

TI Creating a therapeutic psychosocial environment in dementia care. A

AB Research in dementia care during the past few years has focused on
  identifying and designing therapeutic physical environments while the
  psychosocial environment has remained a largely unexplored domain. More
  recently, discussions regarding the effect of the social environment on
  individuals with dementia have increased in the literature.
  Nevertheless, the authors suggest the term "social environment" does not
  adequately represent the critical psychological and emotional effect
  social interaction has on individuals with cognitive impairment. Through
  an examination of the literature, three conceptual frameworks, and
  clinical observations of several special care units (SCUs), the authors
  suggest that the psychosocial environment is the most important element
  of institutional dementia care. A preliminary conceptualization is
  offered which identifies the elements necessary to facilitate a
  supportive psychosocial environment in long-term care. The potential
  benefits of implementing such a model include preservation of
  personhood, simple recognition of remaining abilities and a decreased
  focus on disabilities, and reduction of pharmacologic therapy for
  disruptive behavior resulting in overall improvement in quality of life.

  Insight is lacking on how to translate evidence-based knowledge from

  was used to co-create a conceptual framework with researchers,
  practitioners and older people following an iterative process. Results
  indicate that achieving positive outcomes for people with dementia,
  (in)formal caregivers, and the community is dependent on how well the
  physical, social and organizational environment are congruently
  designed. The theoretical underpinnings of the conceptual model have
  been translated into "the homestead," which is conceptualized around
  three main pillars: activation, freedom and relationships. The Homestead
  Care Model is an illustrative example of how residential care facilities
  can support the development of age-friendly communities that take into

  challenges remain to implement radical changes within residential care.

TI Relationship between familiar environment and wandering behaviour among
  Korean elders with dementia
AB To explore the relationship between wandering behaviour and familiar
  environment in community-residing persons with dementia in Korea.
  Numerous non-pharmacological interventions have been developed to
  decrease behavioural symptoms and to increase the quality of life among
  persons with dementia. Although the concept of familiarity is very
  important and environmental interventions using the concept should have
  been developed for persons with dementia, no study examining even the
  direct relationship between familiar environment and wandering has yet
  been published.
  A descriptive, cross-sectional survey design.
  A convenience sample was gathered of 77 non-institutionalised,
  community-dwelling persons with dementia and their family caregivers in
  Seoul and Wonju, South Korea. Descriptive statics, Pearson's
  correlations, t-tests, and multiple regressions were used in the data
  analysis.
  The mean age of persons with dementia was 76.9 years (SD 8.0) and their
  mean cognitive level score using the Mini-Mental State Examination was
  13.51 (SD 6.10). Most persons with dementia (71.4%) had been diagnosed
  with known types of dementia such as Alzheimer's disease, multiple
  infarct dementia, mixed type or Parkinson's disease with dementia. A
  familiar feeling with the environment was associated with cognitive
  impairment (r = 0.32, p < 0.01) and physical dependency in activities of
  daily living (r = -0.38, p < 0.01). In addition, a familiar feeling with
  the environment (r = -0.56, p < 0.001) and physical dependency in
  activities of daily living (r = 0.56, p < 0.001) were strongly related
  to wandering behaviour. Familiarity and physical dependency in
  activities of daily living were the significant predictors for overall
  wandering and they explained 45% of the total variance. Cognitive
  impairment was the only significant predictor on the subscale of spatial
  disorientation.
  It was found that a familiar feeling with the environment was an
  important factor affecting persons with dementia's cognitive and
  functional abilities as well as specific features of wandering. However,
  future research using a more reliable method is necessary to confirm the
  findings obtained in this study.
  This study suggested that providing persons with dementia with a
  familiar feeling in daily clinical practice through establishment of
  familiar physical as well as psychosocial environment may have benefit
  to decrease wandering behaviour.

  participant attended their allocated intervention (3 x week, for 4
  weeks). Assessments were carried out pre and postsession using the
  Assessment of Motor and Process Skills. Results indicate significant
  improvement in functional performance in both the MSE and the control
  activity. Findings support the use of MSEs as a strategy for enhancing
  functional performance in dementia.

TI Intangible Cultural Heritage: 'Curating' the Human
EA JUL 2022
AB 'Nostalgic environments' are increasingly being created in museums and
  institutional care settings for people with dementia, to support
  residents' capacities for memory and recognition. Drawing upon
  ethnography carried out in a public nursing home specialized in dementia
  care in Copenhagen, Denmark, this paper engages conceptually the
  employment of material heritage within dementia care environments,
  proposing dementia care as a 'curatorial' practice: caregivers act as
  'curators' who re-establish and reorganize the 'meaning' of the
  residents by preserving their individual biographies and societal
  belonging. The analytical alignment of dementia care with the curating
  of cultural valuables reveals that the human is not only the subject
  within-and the creator of-cultural heritage, but also the object: the
  person with dementia is simultaneously an acting subject in care and an
  object for performances of the category of the human. As the curatorial
  care performed in nursing homes preserves not only individual, but also
  collective memories of what it takes to be human and belong in society,
  these institutions should be recognized as significant sites within
  society concerned with the production of meaning, value and cultural
  heritage.

  on the Context of Long-term Care Facilities for People with Dementia
Z1 치매 환자의 건강과 삶의 질 향상을 위한 치유환경 요소에 관한 연구 - 치매 환자를 위한 노인요양시설을 중심으로
AB Purpose: The main purpose of this paper is to assess a body of research
  evidence that articulates the impact of environment-related factors on
  behavioral health and quality of life for people with dementia who
  reside in long-term care facilities. The study also aims at identifying
  design implications that can be incorporated into design process and
  design decisions to improve behavioral health and quality of life for
  people with dementia. Methods: Comprehensive literature review has been
  conducted to identify empirical studies and that link the design of
  dementia care facilities to health- and QOL-related outcomes and
  scrutinized peer-reviewed articles published in many different fields
  including architecture, psychology, to nursing. Results: The review
  identified a growing body of literature that articulates
  environment-related factors that improve health and quality of life for
  people with dementia living long-term care facilities Implications: The
  findings of the review can be translated to design decisions to promote
  psychological and behavioral health and quality of life of people with
  dementia in long-term care facilities.

TI Cognitive-communicative and independent living skills assessment in
  individuals with dementia - A pilot study of environmental impact
AB Individuals with dementia have cognitive deficits that inhibit
  processing information and adapting to environmental changes. The
  environment in which the individual is evaluated may impact assessment
  results. An interdisciplinary approach was used to assess individuals
  with dementia in three settings on independent living skills,
  Significant differences were found between home and clinical settings on
  motor skills, with motor skills higher in (fie home. No significant
  differences were found on social skills, cognitive-communicative skills,
  or instrumental activities. Although contemporary practice emphasizes
  the importance of the environment in individuals with dementia, results
  indicate that these individuals score similarly, across three different
  environments.

TI Promoting safer home environments for persons with Alzheimer's disease.
  The Home Safety/Injury Model.
AB This article describes a Home Safety/Injury Model derived from Social
  Cognitive Theory. The model's three components are safety platform, the
  person with dementia, and risky behaviors. The person with dementia is
  in the center, located on the safety platform composed of the physical
  environment and caregiver competence. The interaction between the
  underlying dementia and indicators of frailty can lead to the person
  with dementia performing risky behaviors that can overcome the safety
  platform's resources and lead to an accident or injury, and result in
  negative consequences. Through education and research, the model guides
  proactive actions to prevent risky behaviors of individuals with
  dementia by promoting safer home environments and increased caregiver
  competence.

TI Rights in Mind: Thinking Differently About Dementia and Disability
AB The aim of this paper is to argue for the utility of a relational model
  of disability, as a way of conceptualizing dementia. We explore whether
  dementia should be considered as a disability, and whether people with
  dementia might consider themselves as disabled people. We review
  examples of, and issues raised by, the political activism of people with
  dementia. We consider how language constructs dementia negatively. We
  discuss how the environment influences the experience of dementia. In
  conclusion, we show that a relational model of dementia lays the basis
  for a human rights approach to the condition, based on collaborative
  partnerships between people with dementia and people from other
  disability communities.

TI Understanding the world of dementia. How do people with dementia
  experience the world?
AB Background: There is growing awareness that the subjective experience of
  people with dementia is important for understanding behavior and
  improving quality of life. This paper reviews and reflects on the
  currently available theories on subjective experience in dementia and it
  explores the possibility of a knowledge gap on the influence of
  neurological deficits on experience in late stage dementia.
  Methods: A literature review on current commonly used theories on
  experience in dementia was supplemented with a systematic review in
  PubMed and Psychinfo. For the systematic review, the terms used were
  Perception and Dementia and Behavior; and Awareness and Dementia and
  Long term care.
  Results: Current models emphasize the psychosocial factors that
  influence subjective experience, but the consequences of neurological
  deficits are not elaborated upon. The systematic literature search on
  the neuropsychological functioning in dementia resulted in 631 papers,
  of which 94 were selected for review. The current knowledge is limited
  to the early stages of Alzheimer's disease. Next to memory impairments,
  perception of the direct environment, interpretation of the environment,
  and inhibition of own responses to the environment seem to be altered in
  people with dementia.
  Conclusions: Without knowledge on how perception, interpretation and the
  ability for response control are altered, the behavior of people with
  dementia can easily be misinterpreted. Research into neuropsychological
  functioning of people in more severe stages and different forms of
  dementia is needed to be able to develop a model that is truly
  biopsychosocial. The proposed model can be used in such research as a
  starting point for developing tests and theories.

TI Creating a dementia-friendly environment through the use of outdoor
  natural landscape design intervention in long-term care facilities: A
  narrative review
AB There is an increasing volume of literature on the positive effects of
  outdoor natural landscapes on health and well-being. However, to date,
  there is a paucity of research on the effect of outdoor natural
  landscapes designed for people with dementia living in long-term care
  (LTC) facilities, in particular, those which have incorporated the
  characteristics of a dementia-friendly environment (DFE). This narrative
  literature review synthesizes current knowledge on the effect of outdoor
  natural landscape design, which is aligned with the characteristics of a
  DFE, to improve agitation, apathy and engagement of people with dementia
  living in LTC facilities. The reviewed studies predominantly support the
  positive effects of outdoor natural landscapes on agitation, apathy and
  engagement of people with dementia. However, there are concerns about
  the methodological approaches, principles incorporated in the applied
  outdoor natural landscapes' designs, and the environmental assessment.
  Further rigorous research is required to understand the impact of the
  outdoor natural landscapes, with the application of DFE characteristics
  in the design, on agitation, apathy and engagement of people with
  dementia living in LTC facilities.

TI A Study on the Quality of Life of Elderly People with Dementia and the
  Environmental Factor of Facilities
Z1 치매노인의 삶의 질과 시설환경 요인에 관한 연구
AB There have lately been a variety of social issues in our society due to
  rapid social changes. Specifically, how to approach elderly people who
  suffer from dementia is never an easy task, and few in-depth studies
  have ever focused on their quality of life due to that. The purpose of
  this study was to examine the quality of life of elderly people with
  dementia and the relationship between their quality of life and the
  environments of facilities for them in an attempt to lay the foundation
  for the development of compatible programs tailored to the environments
  of the facilities and for relevant policy setting. It's ultimately meant
  to improve the quality of life of the elderly with dementia and the
  environments of facilities for them. The subjects in this study were
  elderly people with dementia who were housed in senior residential and
  medical welfare facilities in Daegu and Gyeongsangbukdo. The collected
  data were analyzed with a SPSS 12.0 program, and frequency analysis,
  cross-tabs and multiple logistic regression analysis were utilized. As a
  result, facility environments were identified as one of the variables
  that had a significant impact on the quality of life of the elderly
  people with dementia. There are some suggestions about how to boost
  their quality of life: First, good environments should be prepared in
  consideration of the characteristics of elderly people with dementia in
  order for them to be satisfied with their own quality of life, and the
  way of looking at their potentials should be changed. Second, it's found
  that main caregivers affected the quality of life of the elderly people
  with dementia, and the kind of programs that focus on the improvement of
  the relationship between elderly people with dementia and their main
  caregivers is required. Third, there should be a change in the
  environments of the facilities. The facilities should be well equipped
  to successfully respond to the symptoms of elderly people with dementia.
  To redress their poor accessibility to the facilities, infrastructure
  involving nursing homes and professional personnels should be built by
  utilizing the Internet, and the facilities and local community should
  make concerted efforts to provide quality care to elderly people in want
  of it.
AK 최근 우리 사회는 급격한 사회변동으로 다양한 사회문제를 경험하여 왔다. 특히 치매노인이 접근하기 쉽지 않은 대상이라는 특성 때문에
  치매노인의 삶의 질에 대한 심층적인 연구가 제대로 이루어지지 않고 있다. 이 연구의 목적은 치매노인의 삶의 질을 조사하고,
  치매노인의 삶의 질과 시설 환경과의 관계 분석을 통해 치매노인의 시설 환경에 적합한(compatible) 프로그램 개발이나 다양한
  정책적 및 실천적 방안을 구성하는 데 필요한 기초 자료를 제시하고자 하며, 이를 통하여 치매노인의 삶의 질 향상과 시설 환경적
  문제해결 방안을 모색하는 것이다. 이를 위하여 대구 및 경북지역의 노인주거복지시설 및 노인의료복지시설의 치매노인을 대상으로
  하였으며 수집된 자료는 SPSS 12.0 통계 프로그램을 이용하여 빈도 및 교차분석과 다항로지스틱회귀분석을 하였다. 그 결과
  시설의 환경이 치매노인의 삶의 질에 유의한 영향을 미치는 변인으로 밝혀졌다. 이를 위한 방안으로는 첫째, 치매노인이 만족하는 삶의
  질을 위해서는 치매노인의 특성을 충분히 고려한 환경을 마련하고 치매노인의 잠재능력에 대한 인식전환이 필요하다. 둘째, 주수발자가
  치매노인의 삶의 질에 영향을 주는 것으로 나타난 결과를 미루어 볼 때, 주수발자와의 관계 향상을 위한 프로그램이 필요하다. 셋째,
  시설환경의 변화가 필요하다. 시설들이 치매노인의 증상에 잘 대처해 나갈 수 있도록 준비하고 시설의 접근성이 다소 떨어지는 것에
  대해서는 오프라인(off-line)보다는 온라인(on-line)을 통해 치매노인요양시설과 전담인력 등 인프라를 확충하고,
  지역사회가 긴밀히 협력하여 요양보호를 필요로 하는 어르신께 양질의 요양보호서비스를 제공할 수 있도록 해야 한다.

AB This study examines the frequency of life events before admission and
  before deterioration in 70 dementia patients, in comparison with 50
  dementia controls living in the community and 50 fit elderly people
  matched for age and sex. We hypothesized that there would be an excess
  of events connoting changes in routine and the social environment.
  Specific scales were developed to measure these aspects of events. Our
  results supported the initial hypothesis, confirming that it is the
  social disruptiveness of change rather than the threat implied by life
  events that is associated with deterioration. The findings are discussed
  in the light of current models of the dementia process.

TI Role of Physical Environment in Quality of Life among Residents in
  Dementia Care Facilities through a Longitudinal Observational Study -
  For Facilities in Canada and South Korea -
AB This longitudinal observational study aims to examine whether residents
  with dementia in long-term care facilities with variability in physical
  environment qualities in Vancouver (N=11), Canada and Seoul (N=9), South
  Korea had a difference in their quality of life (QoL). Physical
  environmental assessment was conducted using the Therapeutic Environment
  Screening Survey for Nursing Homes (TESS-NH). QoL was assessed three
  times over one year using Dementia Care Mapping tool. The results of the
  study demonstrated that the residents with dementia living in an
  institutional large-scale setting showed statistically more withdrawn
  behavior and spent more time to be negative mood or affect compared to
  the ones in a small-scale setting. This study also found that the number
  of potential positive behaviors of residents in a small-scale setting
  was three times higher than that of residents in an institutional
  large-scale setting. When looking at the distinction between two
  countries in the behavior category with a large average time difference,
  the residents with dementia in Korea had shorter meal/dessert times
  compared to those in Canada. The study supports that the small-scale
  homelike environment is intensely associated with a therapeutic
  environment for older adults with dementia.
