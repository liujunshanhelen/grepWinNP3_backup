AE SAMSUNG LIFE PUBLIC WELFARE FOUND MED CE
AB 
  NOVELTY - The device (100) has a virtual reality device        
  (102) for providing a virtual reality environment        by an
  image. A display (160) indicates the image        for diagnosing
  neural disease received from an        external device through a
  communication unit. A        sensing part senses operation of a
  user. The        communication unit communicates with the
  external        device and a control unit for inspecting neural 
  disease diagnosis condition. The control unit        determines
  the operation of the user through the        sensing part. A
  first screen introduces an object        in the virtual reality
  environment. The virtual        reality device is provided with
  a second screen for        indicating question about the object.
  USE - Device for diagnosing neural disease i.e.        dementia
  of a patient in a hospital using virtual        reality. Uses
  include but are not limited to        neurodegenerative
  disorder, Alzheimer disease,        blood vessel disease
  dementia, frontotemporal        dementia, corticobasal
  degeneration, progressing        supranuclear paralysis, lewy
  body dementia,        knot-derision senile dementia, Pick's
  disease,        granule disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, 
  motion neural disease, Guam parkinsonism-dementia        
  complex, wrightii nose-beam dig disease, multiple        
  sclerosis, traumatic brain injury and Parkinson's        
  disease.
  ADVANTAGE - The device conveniently performs inspection        
  about the neural disease including dementia by        using the
  virtual reality device without realizing        burden, and
  easily and comfortably determines        internal environment of
  a user, so that burden and        mind stress of the patient can
  be reduced.

  method for diagnosing neural disease i.e. dementia        of a
  patient in a hospital using virtual        reality.

TI A Comparative Review of the Design Guidelines for Dementia-Friendly Care
  Environments in Terms of ‘Person-Centered Care’ Approach
Z1 ‘인간중심 돌봄’적인 측면에서의 치매친화환경지침 비교검토
AB Purpose: This study aims to examine how Person-Centered Care approach
  has affected the long-term elderly care facility design guidelines
  related to the dementia friendly environment, by examining the
  literature on 'Person-Centered Care' highlighted in research; to address
  the policy implications for dementia-friendly environment on basis of
  Person-centered approach. Method: The concept of Person-centered Care
  was defined, and the principles and the design features of
  Person-centered care were derived from literature review focused on
  person-centered Care and the design of environments for people with
  dementia highlighted in research. Based on the facts, this study
  examines how much Person-Centered Care approach affects the design
  guidelines for dementia-friendly environments by comparative review.
  Result: The result shows that the principles and design features of
  Person-centered Care influence on that of the selected design guidelines
  for dementia-friendly elderly care environments directly through
  comparative review. The viewpoint to dementia care environments has
  changed from person-centered care approach for dementia patients based
  on homelike environment to that expanded dementia patients' families and
  staffs who take care of them, based on community. In Korea, the
  direction of dementia care policy is in the process of gradually
  changing from a medical approach to an expanded social and
  person-centered care approach. There is a strong need to establish the
  design guideline for dementia-friendly environments to apply the
  efficient change.

TI A Comparative Analysis on Structure of Design Guidelines for Dementia
  Elderly Care Environment
Z1 치매노인환경을 위한 선도적 디자인 지침의 체계 비교 분석
AB As Korean society has been rapidly aging and a proportion of the elderly
  with dementia has been also increasing, there has been more needs of
  properly designed dementia elderly care environment. To build one that
  is appropriate for the elderly with dementia, having a right guideline
  is a key. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to comparatively
  analyze structures of leading dementia elderly care environment design
  guidelines in order to suggest a base of combing them which could be
  helpful for professionals involved in providing care environment for the
  elderly with dementia. A content analysis method was used in this study
  and 'Therapeutic Environment Screening Scale for Nursing Homes and
  Residential Care(TESS-NH/RC)', 'Dementia Design Checklist(DDC)', 'Matrix
  Bauliche Anforderungen und Bereiche(MBAB)', and 'Environment Dementia
  Care(EDC)' were chosen for a comparative analysis. As a result, these
  guidelines were systematized by a human system and a space system.

TI Dementia patient training system using virtual      reality,
  includes a server providing virtual reality to      a patient with
  dementia connected through a network,      and the server
  implements a virtual environment of      virtual reality
AE C2 MONSTER CO LTD
AB 
  NOVELTY - The system includes a server (100) providing        
  virtual reality to a patient with dementia        connected
  through a network (150). The server        implements a virtual
  environment of virtual reality        and recognizes multiple
  patients in the virtual        environment. A process module
  (110) provides        mission content for improving capability.
  A storage        module (120) stores the mission content, the  
  patient's selection data, operation data, and the        
  patient's mission success data. A communication        module
  (130) communicates with the patient's        terminal through a
  network. A cognitive ability        determination module (140)
  determines the patient's        cognitive ability through the
  patient's selection        data and operation data for a mission
  provided by        the process module. The communication module 
   receives the patient's selection data and motion        data.
  USE - Dementia patient training system using virtual        
  reality.

TI Mary's Little Worlds: Changing Person-Space Relationships When Living
  With Dementia
AB With the case study presented in this article we explore how people with
  dementia experience and use their environment to expand our
  understanding of how architectural environments can improve their
  well-being. We focus on how relationships between people and spaces
  change for people with dementia. Using a qualitative analysis of three
  in-depth interviews with a woman living with dementia, we obtained an
  insider's perspective and a rich account of the changes in her life,
  including her lived experiences and interventions in her home
  environment. We contend that looking at people with dementia in relation
  to and interaction with their environment, combined with an explorative
  research approach, might reveal multiple and innovative possibilities in
  designing for people with dementia. To that end, and to build on
  existing architectural expertise, we suggest focusing on architectural
  ordering principles across different cases.
